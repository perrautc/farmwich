        <p> At Farmwich, we have a commitment to family, freshness, quality, value, and simplicity. We opened our doors in 2018 and had not looked back since.</p>
        <ol>
                <li><strong>Family</strong><br>
                    First and foremost we are a family restaurant. Our mission is to "Feed your family like we do our own." This means generous portions, a friendly attitude, and a welcoming environment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Freshness</strong><br>
                    From the meat to the squeezed fruit juices at the bar, the experience is honest, real & fresh! Nothing is artificial. The produce is the freshest available since we purchase from local sources. Our meats are cured by us and from animals raised on our farm. If you have questions about our products, you can find an expert to willing to speak with you.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Quality</strong><br>
                    We strive for the highest quality in all things - food, beverages, service & experience. The experience for our guests must be the best it can be. Quality doesn’t have to mean expensive; it means caring about what you do and whom you do it for. Our people genuinely want our customers to enjoy their experience, and that starts with preparing everything fresh daily.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Value</strong><br>
                    We are committed to providing value to our customers. Our goal is to meet all the criteria listed here and do so within a reasonable time and moderate price structure. Our quantity is generous; we guarantee you won’t leave hungry.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity</strong><br>
                    We keep things straight-forward and simple. Customers should be comfortable and relaxed. We are not about flash and dazzle.
                </li>
        </ol>

        <p> At Farmwich, we have a commitment to family, freshness, quality, value, and simplicity. We opened our doors in 2018 and have not looked back since.</p>
        <ol>
                <li><b>Family</b><br />
                    First and foremost we are a family restaurant. Our mission is to "Feed your family like we do our own."</li>
                <li><b>Freshness</b><br />
                    From the meat to the squeezed fruit juices in the bar, the experience is honest, real & fresh! Nothing is artificial. 
                    The produce is the freshest available since we purchase from local sources.</li>
                <li><b>Quality</b><br>
                    We strive for the highest quality in all things - food, beverages, service & experience. 
                    The experience for our guests must be the best it can be.
                </li>
                <li><b>Value</b><br>
                    We are committed to providing value to our customers. Our goal is to meet all the criteria listed here and do so within 
                    a reasonable time and moderate price structure.
                </li>
                <li><b>Simplicity</b><br>
                    We keep things straight-forward & simple. 
                    Customers should be comfortable & relaxed! We are not about flash & dazzle.

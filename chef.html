        <p>Charles Brisket was born September 19, 1960, in Baltimore, Maryland. 
            Charles worked as an investment banker for many years before discovering his love 
            for wholesome food. Charles began on his farm before continuing his studies at 
            Le Cordon Bleu. Charles returned to his farm opening up Age Perfect, which featured 
            meats from the farm aged to perfection. The restaurant received "The Best New Restaurant" 
            award from the James Beard Foundation. Brisket continued to open multiple restaurants and 
            write many books, and in 2018 he began the concept what we know today as Farmwich, 
            Brisket announced he was stepping away from the farming operations to focus on delivering 
            the handcrafted perfection full time.</p>

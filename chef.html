        <p>Charles Brisket was born September 19, 1960, in Baltimore, Maryland. Charles worked as an investment banker for many years before discovering his love for wholesome food. Charles began on his farm before continuing his studies at Le Cordon Bleu. Charles returned to his farm opening up Age Perfect, which featured meats from the farm aged to perfection. The restaurant received "The Best New Restaurant" award from the James Beard Foundation. Brisket continued to open multiple restaurants and write many books, and in 2018 he began the concept what we know today as Farmwich, Brisket announced he was stepping away from the farming operations to focus on delivering the handcrafted perfection full time.</p>

        <p>Charles is not spending time slow roasting turkey, or cutting the most delicious ham he does enjoy a few leisure activities. Hi favorite sport is volleyball, if you happen to visit our restaurant over the weekend during the summer, we usually have a couple of sand volleyball nets setup. Our restaurant is closed for two months out of the year, during this time the chef take time to find inspiration. On his most recent journey the chef spent 1 month in Thailand, learning the art of blending heat and flavor. From the trip we have introduced two seasonal favorites to our menu, the Thai ham and the Sweet Chicken livers.

        <p>In my previous career as a Banker, I was always short on time to find food to eat. Spoiled for choices of restaurants but nothing that I felt fit my passion for food with a story. I realize that there had to be a way to balance flavors, speed, and also do it sustainably.</p>
        <p>
        After retiring from the bank, I bought a farm and intended to retire. However, after driving my wife crazy for a few years and wanting to share the abundance of my garden I started inviting friends over to a mini-feast. Before long I had compiled a recipe book of all my favorite things and found new vigor in life. Welcome to Farmwich, what can I slice up for you today.

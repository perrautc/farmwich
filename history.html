        <p>In my previous career as a Banker, I was always short on time to find food to eat. Spoiled for choices of restaurant but nothing that I felt really fit my passion
            for food with a story. I realize that there had to be a way to balance flavors, speed, and also do it sustainably. </p>
        <p>
            After retiring from the bank I bought a farm and
            intended to retire. But after driving my wife crazy for a few years and wanting to share the abundence of my garden I started inviting friends over to a mini-feast.
            Before long I had compiled a recipe book of all my favorite things and found a new vigor in life. Welcome to farmwich, what can I slice up for you today.

            Welcome to Farmwich, we're glad you're here. Farmwich is a sandwich shop which doesn't skimp on the ingredients, flavor or our responsibility to the environment. Several years ago when we dreamt of what an actual farm to table sandwich shop could be, we never imagine that so many people would share in that vision. After many years of building the infrastructure and developing our time-tested combinations, we are happy to welcome you to our restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>   
            We hope you come hungry and with many questions, we are happy to answer your questions and provide you with samples. Since our ingredients are raised antibiotics free and aged to perfection, we know you will be able to taste the difference. We want every bite to be an experience and have worked hard to craft the perfect sandwiches for you. We truly believe in serving you and your family like we do our own, and that means the best ingredients.
        <p>
            We have several award winning sandwiches that are a staple of our menu.
